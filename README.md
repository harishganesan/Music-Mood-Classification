# Music-Mood-Classification
This project classifies music into various moods, using several musical features.
We use features such as : Tempo, Energy, Valence, Arousal, etc.

Then, we use four classifiers to divide these songs based on moods and they are : 

Naive Bayes
Decision Trees
SVM (One v All)
